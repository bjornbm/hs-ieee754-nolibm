This library is a fork of Patrick O'Perry's _ieee754_ library, with the
dependency on _libm_ removed. It relies instead on unspecified behavior.

The only functions from _libm_ used in _ieee754_ are `copysign` and
`copysignf`.  To avoid the _libm_ dependency alltogether in _ieee-754-nolibm_
these functions have been replaced with a pure Haskell implementation, The pure
Haskell implementation is no doubt much slower than _libm_, and probabaly not
correct in all cases involvning _NaN_ on all architectures.

That being said all tests from ieee754 pass on:

* GHC 7.8.3 on Mac OS X 10.9.5.
* GHC 7.8.3 32 bit on Windows Server 2008 RC2.

To pass the `copySign` D5 and F5 tests the `significand` is used to determine
the sign of `y`, which appears to work well when `isNaN y`.  However, per the
Prelude docs the behaviour of `significand` is unspecified on _NaN_ values, so
the apparent success may be particular to the specific test cases and/or the
combination of compiler and architecture.

All functions other than `copySign` are identical to _ieee754_.
